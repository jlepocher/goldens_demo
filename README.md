# What's this?

This sample repository was created in preparation for a talk at Google DevFest London 22: _Golden Tests: the underrated superpowers of Flutter Snapshot Testing_.

This aims to provide a simple and practical setup for golden tests, including responsiveness support.

This repository is likely to be refined in the future and could be uased as a base of further articles around Golden Tests.
