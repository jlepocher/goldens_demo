# What's this?

This sample repository was created in preparation for a talk at Google DevFest London 22: _Golden Tests: the underrated superpowers of Flutter Snapshot Testing_.

This aims to provide a simple and practical setup for golden tests, including responsiveness support.

This repository is likely to be refined in the future and could be used as a base for further articles around Golden Tests.

## Let's test the full widget tree!

Alicja Ogonowska's talk at DroidCon London 22 is a great way to continue to explore testing at high level.

While she focuses on widget tests, most of her strategy and tips are transferrable to golden tests.
